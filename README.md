# Implementing YOLO11 for Real-time Weapon Detection

Developed by Muhammad Arkana Yudhistira

## Background

As crime rates fluctuate and public safety becomes a growing concern, the demand for innovative solutions to enhance security and ensure peace of mind has never been more critical. This project is designed to learn how to implement an advanced machine learning technique, object detection, and use it to solve real-world problems. By exploring the capabilities of YOLO11 (You Only Look Once), an object detection algorithm known for its exceptional speed and accuracy, we will embark on a journey to develop and deploy a system capable of recognizing weapons in diverse settings, ultimately contributing to safer community environments.
